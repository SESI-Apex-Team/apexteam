🏆 Competitions
Our team proudly competes in various national and international robotics competitions:

🇧🇷 | [Rescue Line OBR - RoboCup](https://obr.robocup.org.br/modalidade-pratica/)

The Rescue Line category challenges teams to create autonomous robots that navigate along a predefined path, accurately detecting and rescuing simulated victims while overcoming various obstacles, mimicking real-life rescue operations.

🇧🇷 | [Social Responsibility and Scientific Communication - OBR](https://obr.robocup.org.br/modalidade-pratica/) 

Developing innovative projects with a focus on Social Responsibility and Scientific Outreach.

⚙️ | [Rescue Maze CBR - RoboCup](https://www.cbrobotica.org/) 

Challenging our robots to navigate complex mazes, identify "victims," and simulate real-world rescue operations.
